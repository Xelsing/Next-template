Helper functions are small,
specialized functions that perform specific tasks,
reducing code duplication and improving readability.
They encapsulate reusable logic and adhere to
DRY and KISS principles.

Examples of helper function usage include:

Formatting dates.
Validating data.
Manipulating arrays or objects.
Performing mathematical computations.
